An API gateway is a tool that operates between clients and backend services. API Gateways abstract away all the cross-cutting concerns from the actual applications/micro-services.

- Rate limiting, Request/Response manipulation, Blue Green deployment etc.
- Authentication & Authorization​
- Metrics, Logs and Traces​

Kong is a lightweight, fast, flexible cloud-native API gateway.​
- Lightweight  - It’s a single binary with a size of about ~30 MB
  - One of the key metrics when it comes to choosing the API gateway is speed. How many concurrent requests the API gateway can serve and what’s the latency?

Below is how Kong performs compared to an Envoy-based proxy who claims next generation
