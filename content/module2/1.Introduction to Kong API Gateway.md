An API gateway is a tool that operates between clients and backend services. API Gateways abstract away all the cross-cutting concerns from the actual applications/micro-services.

- Rate limiting, Request/Response manipulation, Blue Green deployment etc.
- Authentication & Authorization​
- Metrics, Logs and Traces​

Kong is a lightweight, fast, flexible cloud-native API gateway.​
- Lightweight  - It’s a single binary with a size of about ~30 MB
  - One of the key metrics when it comes to choosing the API gateway is speed. How many concurrent requests the API gateway can serve and what’s the latency?

Below is how Kong performs compared to an Envoy-based proxy who claims next generation

- Flexible -  Kong's API gateway runtime can be deployed on various platforms, accommodating different infrastructures like bare metal, virtual machines, containers, and serverless environments. Unlike cloud-specific platforms like Apigee, Kong integrates seamlessly with any public cloud vendor.​
- Cloud-native - Kong is designed to run in containers, public/private clouds
- Nginx – Accepting connections and I/O​
- OpenResty – Embedding LuaJIT into NGINX​
- Kong Core​
  - Dynamic API​
  - Gateway API​
  - Plugin Runloop​
  - Core Entities​
- Plugins – Extend the core functionality
