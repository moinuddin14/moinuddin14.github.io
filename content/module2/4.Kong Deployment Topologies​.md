### Kong Deployment Topologies​

##### Traditional (Database) Mode​​
- Kong can be deployed using a single node or multiple nodes. Each node will have all the Kong components. ​​
- A load balancer has to be setup separately when a Kong cluster with multiple nodes are running​​
- Configuration will be synced to all nodes and cached​

##### Hybrid Mode​
- Kong nodes will have a separate role, a CP(Control-plane) or a DP(Data-plane)​
- CPs will have access to Database and contain all Kong components except proxy​
- The DPs will connect to the CP to fetch the configuration

##### DB Less and Declarative Mode​
- Provide the configuration in a declarative YAML/JSON file​
- API is read only​
- Some plugins are not supported​
- DECK
