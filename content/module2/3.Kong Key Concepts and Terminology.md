### Kong Key Concepts and Terminology

##### Service​
- An abstraction of an existing upstream application
- A service object has a name and a URL that points to the upstream service

##### Route​
- Routes map to endpoints that are exposed through the Kong Gateway application​
- A basic route should have a path or paths and reference to an existing service​

##### Upstream Host and Targets​
- The destinations where the incoming requests are proxied or forwarded to after being processed by the gateway.​
- Help in load balancing and scaling the backend services​
- Upstream hosts can be individual servers, containers, or a cluster of servers that host the backend services or APIs

##### Consumers​​
- An entity or client that consumes or accesses APIs exposed through Kong​
- Kong consumers are created and managed within Kong and serve as way to track and control access to APIs​
- Consumers can be individual users, applications, or systems that interact with the APIs exposed through Kong
